## Cento Poetry:
A cento is a poetical work wholly composed of verses or passages taken from other authors, especially the Greek poet Homer and the Roman poet Virgil, disposed in a new form or order. _To Know More_ visit this link [Details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cento_(poetry))

## Blackout Poetry:
A blackout poem is when a poet takes a marker (usually black marker) to already established text—like in a newspaper—and starts redacting words until a poem is formed. The key thing with a blackout poem is that the text AND redacted text form a sort of visual poem. _To Know More_ visit this link [Details](https://www.teachkidsart.net/the-art-of-blackout-poetry/#:~:text=Blackout%20Poetry%20is%20a%20form,words%20you%20don't%20want.)
